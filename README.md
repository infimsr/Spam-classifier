The objective of this Machine Learning model is to build a classifier which separates the spam emails and non-spam emails. 

I have enclosed the R markdown file here. The following points were covered in the code.

- Identified the top 10 predictor variables which distinguishes the spam from non-spam classes.
- Implemented Linear discriminant analysis model onto the dataset and achieved accuracy of 82%.
- Evaluated the model using Lift and Decile charts.
